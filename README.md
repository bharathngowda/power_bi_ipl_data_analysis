# IPL Data Analysis

The goal of the project was to analyze the IPL data from 2008-2020 and derive insights and to predict the winning team. The data was analyzed using [Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/). 
The data for the project was sourced from [Cricsheet](https://cricsheet.org/matches/) and processed and converted to tabular form using Pandas. The data after cleaning and processing was saved as .xlsx file and used to make Power BI charts.
